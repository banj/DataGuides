# About this Project

## Intended Audience

This guide specifically targets teachers who have an interest in aligning their data capture activities with best practice. Due to the nature of their role managing the learning of large groups of students, teachers have numerous opportunities to create, collect, and store data. Some of the potential sources of data that could be collected for future investigation include the common forms of data such as attendance and assessment data, as well as less commonly discussed information such as where particularly student sit in the class, or the number of times each student raises their hand to volunteer an answer.
