              <h3 id="ethics">Ethics</h3>
<p>The <a href="">National Forum on Education Statistics</a> has published a <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010801.pdf">forum guide</a> specifically addressing educators' ethical responsibilities in relation to the collection and sharing of data. The guide is organized into several principles exploring.</p>
<p>Educators undertaking data collection projects should at a minimum consider their responsibilities regarding student consent, data storage &amp; security, and sharing. These issues are specifically addressed by the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/academic/ctl/assessment/iar/teaching/gather/ethics.php">utexas Instructional Assessment Resources</a>.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-variables-to-capture">Selecting Variables to Capture</h3>
<p>One of the first challenges to teachers is identifying which sources of information they wish to expend the effort and time to process into useful data. The tradeoff in time invested vs. value attained is an important consideration. Often, even though the capture of highly detailed data presents exciting possibilities for future analysis, the energy and time required to capture this information makes the practice unsustainable. The best sources of information to monitor will almost always be those which require very little if any change in the daily practice of the teacher, and where change is required, those changes should serve to improve the teachers practice so that additional value can be realized.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about the expanding interest in "Big Data" is the enhancement in our ability to gather information and process it into data in a completely automated way. For the first time, this makes the trade off between time/energy and value a realistic one for the collection of millions of points of data. The proliferation of low cost sensors will only continue to expand the range of information that can be automatically indexed for analysis.</p>
<p>In response to an increase in data, the availability of powerful analytics tools is dramatically expanding. These tools are often free, open source, or both. Teachers have an opportunity to take advantage of the power of these new analytics tools for their own purposes, if they are able to curate collections of data that meet the standards of formatting and storage that are expected by the designers who build tools for data analysis.</p>
<p>Collecting data for more variables corresponds with a greater ability to analyse the data to discover useful intelligence.</p>
<h3 id="establish-a-data-checklist">Establish a Data Checklist</h3>
<p><a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">The Checklist Manifesto</a> outlines the numerous and surprising advantages to embracing checklists for repetative tasks. Data collection just such an activity: repetative, often with stretches of time between additions. Data collection is particuarly sensitive to changes in the way records are recorded, and so it becomes even more important to automate the capture process as much as possible. Teachers should start a simple checklist, and whenever they identify a repetative step, they can add it to their list to check as they add new data. Checks might include confirmation that variables are named in the same way; that dates are formatted in the same way; that numeric data are reported with the same number of significant digits.</p>
<h3 id="anonymizing-your-data">Anonymizing your Data</h3>
<p>From the beginning teachers benefit from keeping in mind that, down the track, they may wish to share their data. Whether that sharing is with other educators, with data scientists who can assist with analysis, or with an academic journal should you wish to publish some of your findings. Whatever the scenario, consider introducing layers of abstraction to personally identifying information of any people, and be sure to take ethical considerations into account.</p>
<p>In columns where you might include student names, consider assigning your own ID numbers, and keeping a separate table linking those ID's to the students themselves. With measures like this, it is a simple matter to hold back that extra linking table to anonymize the data.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-your-data">Sharing your Data</h3>
<p>The world has benefited enormously from a culture of sharing and open source software among software developers. Depending on where teachers find themselves in the world, that culture of sharing may or may not be reflected in their everyday professional experiences. In some schools, a culture of sharing reduces the planning pressures on teachers because lesson plans and curriculum resources are openly and enthusiastically shared. Other schools foster protective cultures where sharing is the exception rather than the norm.</p>
<p>Once you have amassed a collection of data that offers insight into your classroom and practice, consider whether any of part of it would be suitable for sharing. Having taken care to remove any personally identifying information from the collection, it is impossible to predict what uses the data may serve in others projects, and as more collections of clean data from teachers are made available, the possibilities for the creation of tools and services to respond to the data only increase. We all benefit from embracing an attitude of open sharing.</p>
