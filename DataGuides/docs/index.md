## DATA SKILLS FOR EDUCATORS / BEST PRACTICES

The rapid expansion of both knowledge generation and sharing has reflected a worldwide explosion of interest in the use of data to drive decisions and improve outcomes. Educators stand to benefit from the power of the open analytical tools that are being produced at a dizzying rate, if they maintain data collections that conform to the best practices and formats found throughout industry. Frequently, educators' data is locked within proprietary databases, or, perhaps more frequently, is not maintained in a digital state. This guide aims to be a low stakes introduction for educators who want to establish habits for their data collections that will reduce future hurdles to the analysis of their data stores, if and when they elect to seek to learn from it.

There isn't always time, especially with all those (pick all of the following): ungraded papers, meetings, PD requirements, trips, professional duties, calls home, it goes on ad nauseum even before you remember to mention the stunted, neglected personal life.

There isn't time to be doing lots of statistics and data-analysis in the moment; but, with some planning, the process of data capture and storage doesn't need to be a headache. The more time that passes, the more data that is accumulated, the more attractive is is to draw insights out of it. Capturing those data and keeping them safe should be the concern of every educator. This guide is intended to be a cold-bucket-of-water over-the-head introduction to some of the important principles that, if followed, will allow you or others to work with your data in the future without too much pain.
