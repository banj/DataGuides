This list is a tool for Educators to help ensure that their datasets align with the best practices described in this guide.

### Types of Data

* Missing values are coded as 'NA'
* Categorical and Ordinal variables are not encoded with numbers
* All information about observations is encoded using text (as opposed to color, cell size, etc.)


### Keeping a code book

* Code book contains data type and units of all variables in a section called "Code book"
* Code book contains a description of how you collected the data in a section called "Study design"


### Data sharing

* A backup of all raw data has been maintained


#### [Tidy Data set](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing#the-tidy-data-set)

* Each variable measured is in one column
* Each different observation of that variable is in a different row
* Each table contains only one type of variable
* For multiple tables, a column is included that allows them to be linked
* Top row of each table contains full row names, not abbreviations


##### For excel

* One excel file per table
* No multiple worksheets
* No macros
* No non-text information (highlights, etc.)
